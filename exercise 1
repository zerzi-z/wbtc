I know that there could be the possibility that a interest becomes a job and in this case there would be the opportunity to rederict the link within the page.
In the next 5 to 10 years i assume it should hold up. To be completely honest I dont know what happens in more than 10 years and if we use the web the same way we do right know.

ELI5 Linked Data
----------------------------------------------------
Your name is Alice. Your best friends name is Bob. So if you are both in one room and I say "Hy Alice" you know that I talk to you. So in this case your name is the URI and the room is the world wide web. In other words URI is just a fancy grown up word for name with the addition that every name can only be used one time. So there is no other Bob or Alice in the room. Because you know Bob there is a link between you (Alice) and Bob. Now Bob has an age, height, name and hobby’s as well as many other parameters. You (Alice) also have many parameters. Now we could compare the two of you. You have the same age and the same hobby’s. Now imagine if all the people of this world would be linked together. Now we could see how many people are at the same age as you (Alice) and Bob, or how many people have the same hobby’s. Then we could check if people are between 5-7 years old they have all the same hobby’s. Now thanks to all people linked together we can check if this hypothesis is correct. So very shorty everything is linked together and then because everything is linked together we have a lot of data, which also means that we now can check many different hypotheses and get good answers.
